# Contribute to the radar

Quadrants:
- Languages & Frameworks - What we write our software in (Development)
- Platforms - What we run our software systems on and where we persist our data (Operations)
- Tools - What we use on the side to improve the way we develop and operate our systems (Dev & Ops)
- Techniques - What methods & practices we follow
- 

Rings:
- Adopt - Mature and ready for use. You should be using these technologies if they are appropriate for your problem.
- Trial - Proven to be ready for use but not yet widely used. Should be carefully monitored when used in production.
- Assess - Something new that we are excited about but not yet sure it is production ready. Evidence why it solves a particular problem should be collected through some kind of POC.
- Hold - We know these are not ready for use or we are actively avoiding going forward.
